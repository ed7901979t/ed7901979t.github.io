By utilizing sifting through data we can obtain the data readable, or 
more organized data. With webscraping we scan through a page
and complie a list of needed and organized data.
One of the solutions to make it eaiser to complete scraping is Nokogiri.
It is an open-source web-scraping library. The parsing process
is implemented through XML documents or HTML in Ruby. One of popular
gems for web-scraping is OpenURI. Such an apporach implements
HTTP Request method. By completing such a process it is important
not to forget adding .text to the end of variable with information.
