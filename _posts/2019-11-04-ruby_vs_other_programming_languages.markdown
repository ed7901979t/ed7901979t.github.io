Ruby is a great and true object oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan in the mid 1990’s. The

Ruby is a pure programming language. It has many similarities to Lisp, ADA, and Perl.

What are the advantages over other languages?

The language has no complex rules and the code is designed to be simple by syntax.

The language is an open source and free for the changes to be made by other programmers.

Ruby programs are run as an interpreted language where in java in must be compiled and executed

Ruby has no data types as Java

Ruby utilizes dynamic typing vs. static for Java

Ruby has support and popular use of Ruby on Rails, and support for AWS with Lambda.

At the same time, Java has its own advantages of syntax derived from C, some consider Java as a standard for

enterprise computing, multithreading capabilites and more.

The weaknesses are present at each language including Ruby and Java.

Java: Memory leak and Garbage collector may slowdown the code execution.

Ruby: flexibility for strict rules for some who don’t like that as an example for four different ways to define method, run

time speed.

Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages and it is up to a developer to select the appropriate option

for designe developed methdology for a project to be used.
